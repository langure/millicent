The R² score is 0.9820, which is still very high, indicating the model explains about 98% of the variance in "Calificación 3 er parcial" using the remaining features.
The most important predictors are now "IECONOMIA", "IADMINTRA", "ICONTAFIN", "IADERECHO", "IMERCADOC", and "IMATEMEST"—all of which appear to be subject or area-specific scores.
The predicted vs. actual plot shows a strong linear relationship, with predictions closely matching actual values, but with a bit more spread than before (which is expected after removing directly related columns).
The residuals plot shows most errors are small and centered around zero, but with a wider spread than before, indicating the model is not simply memorizing the target.
Interpretation for a school principal:

The third partial grade ("Calificación 3 er parcial") can be predicted very accurately using the students' scores in specific subject areas (economics, administration, accounting, law, marketing, mathematics).
These subject scores are the main drivers of the final grade, while demographic and identification variables (like SEXO, ENTI_NAC, etc.) have minimal influence.
The model is now providing insight into which academic areas most influence the final grade, rather than just reproducing a formula.
This analysis can help you understand which academic strengths are most closely associated with higher final grades, and may inform targeted interventions or support for students in specific subjects.
